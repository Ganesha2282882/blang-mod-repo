Ion Half Proprietary Software License
****
Preamble
====
The IHPSL is a half-properietary license. You can use it in your project.

Actions that aren't allowed
====
i. You may **not** copy the code and change the license. That can easily be a way to bypass these restrictions, but it's not allowed.

ii. You may **not** hack into the software/companies' servers, code repos, accounts, and other digital properties.

iii. You may **not** torrent/crack the software without permission from software vendor.

iv. You may not use large blocks of code from another open source software project, but that's fine with projects that use the IHPSL and code from proprietary software if you had permisson to do so.

v. You may not release the code even if there is a source code leak.

vi. You may not attempt to use an API key in the code.

Actions that are allowed
====
i. Forking

ii. Use copies that aren't cracked (you payed for the copy)

iii. Torrenting/using code if you have permission
